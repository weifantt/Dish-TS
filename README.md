Source code for the paper,
["Dish-TS: A General Paradigm for Alleviating Distribution Shift in Time Series Forecasting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14829),
in AAAI 2023.

## Overview
Dish-TS is a general paradigm for time series forecasting against distribution shift.

## Usage
Similar to [reversible instance normalization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cGDAkQo1C0p), Dish-TS is model-agnostic such that it can be coupled with any forecasting architectures.
